# Predict Machine Maintenance Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of machine failures using data from the [AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ai4i-2020-predictive-maintenance-dataset). The goal is to create models that can predict failures based on various features such as temperature, torque, and rotational speed.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models for failure prediction
- Condition-based monitoring

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ai4i-2020-predictive-maintenance-dataset). The data includes various metrics like temperature, torque, and speed that can be used to predict different types of machine failures.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
